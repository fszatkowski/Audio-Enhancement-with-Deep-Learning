# Audio Enhancement with Deep Learning

## About

Repo for code used for master thesis at Warsaw University of Technology. 
Thesis included denoising and upsampling audio files using DNN architectures 
such as autoencoders, SEGAN and WaveNet.

## Setup

To setup on ubuntu, run:

```
./scripts/setup_project.sh
pip install -r requirements-to-freeze.txt
```

Not sure if it will work on other systems.

# Demo app

![](demo_screenshot.png?raw=true)

Demo app allows to:
- load audio, 
- apply selected noise, 
- process audio with NN model 
- play original audio or any audio generated by applying noise or model inference
- save audio generated by applying noise or model inference

To run demo:

```
python src/demo.py
```
